          <h2>What is Gender Selection?</h2>
          <p>
            Gender selection refers to the process of choosing the sex of a baby before conception or implantation. 
            This can be done for medical reasons, such as preventing genetic disorders linked to a specific gender, 
            or for personal preference in some countries.
          </p>

        {/* Methods */}
        <section>
          <h2>Medical Techniques for Gender Selection</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Preimplantation Genetic Testing (PGT):</strong> Used during IVF to analyze embryos before transfer. This is the most accurate method for gender selection.</li>
            <li><strong>Sperm Sorting (MicroSort):</strong> Separates X and Y chromosomes in sperm. Not widely available in Sri Lanka.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        {/* Legal Context */}
        <section>
          <h2>Is Gender Selection Legal in Sri Lanka?</h2>
          <p>
            In Sri Lanka, gender selection is <strong>strictly regulated</strong>. It is generally prohibited for non-medical reasons 
            and allowed only when there is a medical need, such as preventing genetic diseases associated with a specific sex.
          </p>
        </section>

        {/* Ethical Considerations */}
        <section>
          <h2>Ethical Considerations</h2>
          <p>
            The Sri Lankan Medical Council and fertility specialists emphasize that gender selection should not be used for 
            cultural or social preference, as it raises concerns about gender imbalance and discrimination.

        {/* Risks */}
        <section>
          <h2>Risks and Limitations</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Additional cost and complexity during IVF treatment.</li>
            <li>Emotional and ethical stress for intended parents.</li>
            <li>No 100% guarantee unless PGT is used.</li>
