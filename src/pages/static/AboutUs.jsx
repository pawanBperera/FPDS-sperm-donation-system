    <p>
      Our mission is to provide an ethical and medically secure sperm donation service in Sri Lanka. 
      We aim to bridge the gap between intended parents, donors, clinics, and legal professionals by 
      offering a streamlined platform that handles everything from donor-recipient matching to legal 
      and health compliance.

  </h2>
  <div className="info-card">
    <p>
      Our platform uses a structured workflow where intended parents can
      create profiles, search for verified donors, and request matches.
      Donors are thoroughly screened through medical and legal checks
      before being added to our system. An admin team verifies every
      match to ensure compatibility and safety, particularly considering
      genetic conditions such as thalassemia and other inheritable
      diseases.
